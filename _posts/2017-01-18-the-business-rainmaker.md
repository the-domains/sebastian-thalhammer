  In business, a rainmaker is a person who brings in new business and wins new
  accounts almost by magic, since it is often not readily apparent how this new
  business activity is caused. It means generating substantial new business or
  additional cash flow from sources sometimes outside established business
  channels, sometimes by connecting with people in non-traditional or hidden
  markets, and sometimes by prompting current clients to spend more money.

# The Business Rainmaker

> The role of the rainmaker is to find a dormant business problem and then create a vision of what life could be like if that problem were solved.

In business, a **rainmaker** is a person who brings in new business and wins new accounts almost by magic, since it is often not readily apparent how this new business activity is caused. It means generating substantial new business or additional cash flow from sources sometimes outside established business channels, sometimes by connecting with people in non-traditional or hidden markets, and sometimes by prompting current clients to spend more money.

Most digital marketing agencies have it wrong.

They focus on "cutesy" designs, page views and vanity metrics such as Facebook likes when all they should be doing is **getting you customers** and bringing you back a return on your investment.

Most web design shops and digital marketing agencies are run by design oriented hipsters on fancy Mac computers with their only objectives being advertising awards, respect from other agencies and "cutesy designs".

If you want to dominate your market, have hot ready to buy customers flood to your business in droves and consistently get results then lets talk.
